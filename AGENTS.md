# moray-game — The Reef Between Seas

A calm 3D moray-eel diving and discovery game built with TypeScript, Vite and Three.js.
This repository contains the **vertical slice** from the design blueprint: a greybox
"Sunlit Coral Garden" reef with a supporting fish school, comfort-aware swimming, four
distinct discoverable morays recorded into the Codex, a versioned save system, a
comfort/accessibility settings panel with Calm Mode, and the Dream Sanctuary aquarium.

## Layout

- `src/app/` — `Game` wiring, fixed-timestep `GameLoop`, `RendererAdapter` (WebGL).
- `src/player/` — `DiveController` (pure physics), `CameraRig` (comfort options), `InputController`.
- `src/world/` — `Reef` greybox + `CollisionField`.
- `src/creatures/morays/` — data-driven `MoraySpeciesConfig`, `MorayRegistry`, procedural `Moray`.
- `src/creatures/fish/` — `FishSchoolSystem` (instanced ambient fish).
- `src/discovery/` — `FocusScanner`, `DiscoverySystem`, `HintSystem` (all pure/testable).
- `src/rendering/` — fog, lighting, caustics, particles.
- `src/sanctuary/` — `SanctuaryScene` (separate scene rendered when in sanctuary mode).
- `src/save/` — `SaveSystem` + `SaveMigration` (versioned localStorage).
- `src/ui/` — `Hud`, `Codex`, `SettingsPanel`, `SanctuaryOverlay`.
- `src/accessibility/` — comfort settings + Calm Mode preset.
- `tests/` — Vitest unit tests (pure gameplay logic, no WebGL).
- `tests-e2e/` — Playwright tests (render, codex, discovery, sanctuary, calm mode, save,
  comfort-panel keyboard access).

## Commands

All standard commands live in `package.json` scripts: `dev`, `build`, `preview`,
`typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `test:watch`, `test:e2e`.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

- **Node**: the VM has Node 22 available; no version manager pinning is required. `npm`
  is provided via nvm's Node 22 install — both resolve to Node 22, so either works.
- **Running the app**: `npm run dev` serves on `http://localhost:5173` (host exposed).
  Use dev mode, not `npm run build`/`preview`, for development.
- **e2e tests need a browser**: run `npx playwright install chromium` once (the update
  script does this). `playwright.config.ts` starts/reuses the dev server on port 5173
  automatically via its `webServer` block — do not start a second dev server on 5173
  before running `npm run test:e2e` unless you want it reused.
- **Renderer**: rendering goes through `RendererAdapter` (WebGLRenderer). Keep new
  render code behind that adapter; a WebGPU swap should touch only that file.
- **Manual/scripted testing gotcha (discovery)**: the hero moray sits *nearly straight
  ahead of the spawn point, only slightly below center*, and its head deliberately peeks
  out in front of the coral mound (line of sight must be clear, or `DiscoverySystem`
  treats it as obstructed). To discover it, swim forward with `W` for ~1.5s from spawn
  (that coasts to a stop around 7.5m out, mid-way through the 1.2m–14m focus band), then
  hold still with the view centered for ~1.5s while the reticle ring fills. When
  driving the browser programmatically, do **not** use mouse-look or arrow keys — pointer
  lock jitter and tilting push the (roughly level) moray out of the focus cone. Just press
  `W`, then hold. Focus tuning lives in `DEFAULT_FOCUS_PARAMS` (`src/discovery/FocusScanner.ts`);
  spawn/crevice placement lives in `Game` and `Reef`.
- **Save persistence gotcha**: discoveries and comfort settings persist in `localStorage`
  (key `reef-between-seas.save.v1`), so on a returning profile the reef may already show
  discovered morays. Load `http://localhost:5173/?reset=1` to force a fresh dive when
  demoing or manually testing discovery. `Game` is constructed with `{ resetSave }` from
  that URL flag (see `src/main.ts`).
- **Keys**: `C` Codex, `H` hint, `V` toggle Dream Sanctuary, `O` toggle settings. The
  sanctuary is a separate scene/camera; while it is open the reef simulation is paused and
  the dive HUD is hidden. Opening the settings panel also pauses the reef simulation.
- **Input ownership gotcha**: the dive claims Space and the arrow keys, so
  `InputController` steps aside (no `preventDefault`, no key tracking) whenever the event
  target is a form control — otherwise the comfort panel's checkboxes and field-of-view
  slider cannot be operated from the keyboard. The `C`/`H`/`V`/`O` shortcuts stay global
  (so `O` always closes the panel) and ignore `event.repeat` so holding a key toggles once.
- **Sanctuary rebuild gotcha**: `SanctuaryScene.setSpecies` runs on every discovery and
  every time the sanctuary opens. It disposes the previous residents' geometries and
  materials; drop that and the GPU copies accumulate for the rest of the session. Reef and
  sanctuary morays are separate `Moray` instances with their own resources, so disposing
  sanctuary residents never touches the reef.
- **Finding the darker morays**: only the snowflake moray sits straight ahead of spawn. The
  ribbon (left), zebra (right) and dragon (deeper, forward-left) require turning and are
  intentionally harder to spot — the zebra/dragon heads are dark against their caves. Use
  the `H` hint ladder (it targets the nearest undiscovered moray). All four are verified
  discoverable; placement/facing live in `SPOT_PLACEMENTS` in `src/world/Reef.ts`.
- The Vite build prints a >500 kB chunk warning (Three.js in one bundle). This is expected
  and is not an error.
